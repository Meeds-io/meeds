= II. STARTUP INSTRUCTIONS =

The file README.txt contains information on how to start the product.

= III. UPGRADE NOTES =

The upgrade procedure is only guaranteed and tested to be transparent from the previous maintenance version (x.y.z from x.y.z-1). So, we recommend to apply upgrade procedures for all versions between your current and the target one.
However, if you still insist on skipping versions, we strongly advise to read all upgrade notes of the versions you are skipping to see if your project is impacted by any previous upgrade procedure.

== Upgrading from the previous Platform version (since Platform 5.1) ==

Since Platform 5.1, the file upgrade.properties is not used anymore, the upgrade process has been simplified to:
* Move data (files + database) to the new Platform installation
* Start the server. You're ready.

== Upgrading from the previous Platform version (before Platform 5.1) ==

* Prepare bundle:
** If eXo Platform is connected to a populated organizational data source, Organization Integration Service must be activated so that the data are synchronized. Please refer to chapter 7 "LDAP Integration" in Administrator Guide for the detail.
** Go to $PLATFORM-${org.exoplatform.platform.version}-TOMCAT_HOME/gatein/conf/ folder (Tomcat bundle).
** Rename upgrade—sample.properties to upgrade.properties
* Start server. The upgrade will be run automatically.
* Stop server.
* Remove/Rename the file upgrade.properties
* Restart the server. You're ready.

=== Troubleshooting ===

In a cluster environment, database locks issues can happen when starting the nodes the first time after the upgrade.
The best solution to fix this is to start and stop completely one of the nodes to do the upgrade, then start the cluster.

=== Description of the plugins used in this upgrade ===

In addition, upgrade scripts are automatically run at startup in this version to migrate wiki and social data from JCR to JPA.
Wiki data migration is done synchronously, meaning that the eXo Platform instance will be available only once the data migration is done.
Social data migration is done asynchronously, meaning that the data migration will run after the eXo Platform start.

=== Architecture changes ===

Since the version 4.4.0, eXo Platform requires Elasticsearch.
eXo Platform is shipped with an embedded version of Elasticsearch which automatically starts when eXo Platform starts.
This embedded Elasticsearch instance is recommended for development and test but not for production.
For production it is recommended to run a standalone Elasticsearch cluster (please refer to Elasticsearch official documentation for more details).
In order to use a standalone Elasticsearch cluster, the following properties must be defined in exo.properties:
* exo.es.embedded.enabled=false - Disable the default Embedded Elasticsearch
* exo.es.index.server.url=<indexing_URL> - URL of the node used for indexing
* exo.es.search.server.url=<searching_URL> - URL of the node used for searching

For advanced configuration and more details please refer to the eXo Platform documentation.

=== Unified search ===

*  Data must be reindexed in order to apply the fix INTEG-458 for existing contents.

* Prepare bundle:
** If eXo Platform is connected to a populated organizational data source, Organization Integration Service must be activated so that the data are synchronized. Please refer to chapter 7 "LDAP Integration" in Administrator Guide for the detail.
** Go to $PLATFORM-${org.exoplatform.platform.version}-TOMCAT_HOME/gatein/conf/ folder (Tomcat bundle) or $PLATFORM-${org.exoplatform.platform.version}-JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/gatein/ folder (Jboss bundle).
